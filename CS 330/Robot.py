# """Created By Vien Trieu and Raiz Mohammed 
#    Created on 10/5/2023 
#    This code is set up to make Benjamin drive 4 feet then turn and drive 4 feet then turn four times. We used many different types of methods but ended up just using the regular time.sleep
#    Once we got it to finally drive four feet and stop, we just copied and pasted to see how it would do, and it liked to just do its own thing and we tweaked the last two drive and turns as they were not
#    allowing us to drive Benjamin right on the tape. We also have this code splt up to show where each drive and turn is. This robot now should be able to drive 4 feet turn and do this 4 times to make a
#    a perfect square."""
